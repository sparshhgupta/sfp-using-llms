We initially attempted to use the Hugging Face API to connect with CodeLlama, but its performance did not meet our expectations. For our needs—code debugging and completion—CodeLlama-Instruct seemed like a better fit. However, using it required license acceptance, which remained pending for too long. To overcome this, we shifted to running CodeLlama-7B-Instruct in Google Colab, changing the runtime type to GPU for better performance.
