Alright, so after reviewing the code again, I can confirm that there's a clear issue with the divide_numbers function.
</think>

The provided code contains a potential bug due to division by zero.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Identify the Problem**: The `divide_numbers` function on line 10 performs division of two numbers (a and b). However, if the denominator 'b' is zero, this will result in a division by zero error.

2. **Determine the Impact**: Attempting to divide any number by zero raises an unhandled exception in Python, which can crash the program or lead to erroneous results.

3. **Solution**: To fix this issue, we need to add a condition before performing the division to check if 'b' is zero. If it is, handle the error appropriately, such as displaying an error message or returning `None`.

**Corrected Code:**

```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result

def multiply_numbers(a, b):
    result = a * b
    return result

def divide_numbers(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        print("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.")
        return None  # or handle as needed
    result = a / b
    return result
```

**Summary of Changes:**

- **Added Check for Zero Denominator**: In the `divide_numbers` function, we now check if 'b' equals zero. If true, an error message is printed, and the function returns `None`.

This corrected code prevents division by zero errors and handles such cases gracefully.
