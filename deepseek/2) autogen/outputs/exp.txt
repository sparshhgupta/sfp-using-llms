Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with this code. Let me look at each part carefully.

First up is the add_numbers function on line 2. It takes two arguments, a and b, adds them together, stores it in 'result', and then returns that result. Hmm, nothing seems off here. Simple addition; looks good to me.

Next is multiply_numbers on line 6. Similar structure: takes a and b, multiplies them, stores in 'result', and returns. Also looks fine. Multiplication doesn't seem tricky unless there's some edge case I'm missing, but the code itself seems straightforward.

Now onto divide_numbers on line 10. Takes a and b, divides a by b, stores it in 'result', then returns. Wait a minute—this function is where things might go wrong. If someone calls this with b being zero, Python will throw an error because you can't divide by zero. That's definitely a bug.

Looking at all the functions together, they're pretty simple without any loops or complex logic. The main issue is just that single line in divide_numbers where division by zero could happen.

So, to summarize:
- Line 10: Potential division by zero error when b is zero.
</think>

The code provided has a potential issue in the `divide_numbers` function:

**Fault Identification:**

- **Line 10 (`def divide_numbers(a, b):`)**: The function may raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if `b` is zero. This occurs because division by zero is undefined and will crash the program when encountered.

**Summary of Faults:**

- **Line 10**: Potential for division by zero error in `divide_numbers(a, b)` function.
